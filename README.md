libgcrypt
=========

LibGCrypt with custom native Visual Studio project build tools. LibGCrypt: Libgcrypt is a general purpose cryptographic library based on the code from GnuPG. It provides functions for all cryptograhic building blocks: symmetric ciphers (AES, DES, Blowfish, CAST5, Twofish, SEED, Camellia, Arcfour), hash algorithms (MD4, MD5, RIPE-MD160, SHA-1, SHA_224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, TIGER-192, Whirlpool), MACs (HMAC for all hash algorithms), public key algorithms (RSA, Elgamal, DSA, ECDSA), large integer functions, random numbers and a lot of supporting functions.
